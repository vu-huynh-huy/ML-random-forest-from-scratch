## Random Forest
Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique. It is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random Forest is an improvement over bagged decision trees.
